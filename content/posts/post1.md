It hasn’t been an easy ride to build this website—especially with my lack of web development experience. But I can confidently say I’ve learned a ton about the tools and technologies powering this site, and I’m here to share the messy journey.

### Why GitHub Pages and 11ty?  
My goal was to host this site on GitHub Pages, which meant sticking to **static site generators**. After seeing another developer struggle with self-hosting due to their non-static tech stack, I knew I needed a simpler path. Enter [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).  

At first, I thought 11ty’s templates would make this a walk in the park. Spoiler: it wasn’t. When I opened the default template in VS Code, I froze—**so many files**, so much code, and zero idea where to start. I tinkered with minor tweaks, but the rigid structure stifled my design creativity.  

So, I did the only logical thing: **scrapped the template entirely** and started from scratch.

### Baby Steps and Breakthroughs  
Armed with basic HTML/CSS knowledge from a web dev course I’d taken the previous semester, I dove into 11ty’s documentation. Progress was slow, but every tiny victory kept me going—whether it was fixing a rage-inducing bug after two hours of Googling or finally understanding how layouts worked.  

Eventually, I circled back to the template I’d abandoned earlier—this time, not to copy it, but to **borrow inspiration** for my own design. I embraced 11ty’s [layout system](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/layouts/) to structure pages consistently, and things started falling into place.

### The To-Do List Grind  
Once the skeleton of the site was built, I drafted a checklist of everything needed for launch: optimizing code, adding comments I’d lazily skipped, and experimenting with [Nunjucks](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/nunjucks/) templating (a short-lived attempt—**it’s still on my bucket list**).

### The Final Stretch  
Two hours. That’s how long I spent agonizing over the perfect color scheme (you better appreciate that palette). After endless tweaks, the site was finally “presentable”—or at least, not embarrassing.
