Seems like I’m not getting anything right on the first try. In this edition of *Dev Odysseys*, I’ll share the rollercoaster of deploying my website—complete with rage-quits, AI rescues, and GitHub Pages chaos.

### **“It’ll Be Easy,” They Said**  
In my [last post](https://rsomonte.github.io/posts/post1/), I bragged about how 11ty would simplify deployment. **Foreshadowing alert**: this is where the universe decided to humble me (thank god y’all can’t see my graveyard of deleted repos).  

I did what any sane person would: Googled *“11ty GitHub Pages”*. Dozens of tutorials popped up. “ez win!” I thought. **Spoiler**: It was not.

### **The Great GitHub Pages Meltdown**  
First attempt: followed a tutorial. Styles broke. Links back to home. Tried manual fixes. Nothing. Switched to another guide. Same result. By this point, I’d had a *very* intense weekend and just wanted to finish this project. So I had only one last ace up the sleeve: **rage-quit**.

### **Redemption Arc (Thanks, 11ty Docs)**  
Next day, fresh coffee in hand(not quite, coffee is *disgusting*), I crawled back to [11ty’s website](https://www.11ty.dev/). Their **site-wide search** is like Bruno, we don't talk about it; but after some digging, I struck gold: the [official deployment guide](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/deployment/#deploy-an-eleventy-project-to-github-pages).  

**It's alive!** Their method worked… *mostly*. Styles still looked like a first grader's father's day website. However, I sometimes have genius ideas: I remembered that we live in the 21st century, and we have the commodity of AI to help us in some ocassions. A few prompts later, the last gremlins were squashed.

### **Dear Future Me (and You)**  
If you’re reading this while battling outdated 2022 tutorials (or worse, **2020** relics), know this: you’re not alone. Next time I’m drowning in deployment hell, I’ll drag y’all down with me—*gloriously*.  

**Thanks for reading!** If you’ve survived a deployment disaster, tell me about it—misery loves company.
