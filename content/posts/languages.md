## <u>Top Language Learning Applications</u>

### Babbel  
**Score: 10/10**  

Topping my list is Babbel, which I consider the most complete application available. Its placement as the second-most-famous app is likely due to strong advertising, but the product quality justifies the recognition. The app is packed with features, including audio exercises, realistic scenario practice, advanced vocabulary, and clear grammar explanations. What's particularly impressive is the inclusion of regional variations for languages like Spanish. I can't identify a single missing element, and I've seriously considered the lifetime subscription because of how extensively I study languages. Its only drawback is that a significant portion of its content requires a paid subscription.

### Busuu  
**Score: 9/10**  

It's surprising that Busuu isn't more widely known outside of dedicated language-learning circles. It presents a broad selection of languages with specialized courses for general studies, business, or travel. The lessons effectively blend grammar, vocabulary, culture, and pronunciation, explaining grammatical concepts in a straightforward manner before prompting you to apply the knowledge. The power of Busuu lies in its emphasis on spaced repetition. Its most innovative feature is the community section, where you can submit written or oral exercises and receive feedback from native speakers. In return, you can help others learning your native language. While the free tier is well-balanced with some ads and daily limits, the premium plan unlocks an ad-free experience, offline access, and official certificates.

### Memrise  
**Score: 9/10**  

Memrise remains a personal favorite, despite the limitations of its free version. It utilizes three main learning methods: standard lessons, short videos featuring native speakers, and an AI chat. The use of native speaker videos is a huge plus for nailing pronunciation. While it doesn't explicitly teach grammar, the vocabulary provided is rich and extensive. The AI Chat function is a standout, allowing you to practice in realistic scenarios and receive corrections on your mistakes. The main downside is that the free plan locks a large number of lessons, which isn't an issue with Duolingo or Busuu.

### Mango Languages  
**Score: 7/10**  

I find Mango Languages the most difficult to review, partly because I've used it less than the others. The app is built on the premise that conversation is the key to learning, so its lessons are structured like dialogues. It offers a unique hands-off listening mode, which allows you to follow lessons while driving, cooking, or doing chores, reminiscent of old cassette-based language courses. While this method isn't my personal preference, I don't have a negative view of it, leading me to give it a standard score.

### Drops  
**Score: 7/10**  

Drops takes a very simplistic approach, teaching words by associating them with images and sounds. The exercises are quick and perfectly suited for short bursts of learning, like during a bus ride. This method might be especially effective for children. The app serves its purpose as a quick, effortless tool, but it's neither groundbreaking nor flawed. The free version is restricted to five minutes of practice per day, though you can split this time up as you wish.

### Tandem  
**Score: 7/10**  

Tandem operates less as a learning app and more as a social network for language practice with native and non-native speakers. Its strengths lie in its filtering system for finding practice partners and a built-in tool for making and receiving corrections. The app holds a lot of potential if you can use it effectively. My own experience was hampered by slow response times from other users, which made it hard to maintain a conversation. However, since I haven't used it in years, it's possible the user base is more active now.

### Duolingo  
**Score: 5/10**  

As the world's most famous language app, Duolingo is often the first stop for beginners, but I strongly discourage its use. While its vocabulary bank is varied, the lesson structure fails to build a deep understanding of the language. The complete absence of grammar explanations is a major flaw; student-friendly grammar lessons are possible and necessary. Where Duolingo excels is in habit formation. Its notorious reminders and streak system are incredibly effective at keeping users consistent, which is crucial when forming a new habit.
