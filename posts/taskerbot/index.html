<p>Developing my latest project, a Discord bot called <a href="https://github.com/rsomonte/taskerbot">Taskerbot</a>, has been an interesting journey full of unexpected turns. The inspiration came from a bot I saw during an event on a Discord server that gamified tasks, and I decided to build my own version. This project quickly evolved into a valuable lesson in modern bot development, especially after a five-year hiatus from the Discord API.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Initial Spark</h3>
<p>The concept for Taskerbot came to me a few months ago, inspired by a server event where users submitted tasks for points. Having built bots before, I thought it would be a walk in the park, but I quickly realized my expectations were a bit unrealistic given how much the landscape had changed.</p>
<hr>
<h3>From Memory to Persistence: A Hosting Hurdle</h3>
<p>One of the first hurdles I encountered after the initial release was finding a place to host it. I started with Railway, but I'll likely be migrating to a different host soon. Their free plan doesn't support volumes, which became essential for the bot's functionality.</p>
<p>In the first version of Taskerbot, all tasks and objectives were stored in memory. This meant that every time I pushed an update, all that data was wiped. To solve this, I integrated SQLite for persistent storage, which required a volume to hold the database file.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Adapting and Evolving Features</h3>
<p>Persistent storage hasn't been the only major change since the first release. I've also implemented a streak system to encourage consistent participation and a delete command for easier task management. To help users stay on track, I recently added a feature where the bot sends a direct message if it notices an objective has been available for over 24 hours without a submission. Another key feature is a 22-hour submission cooldown. This gives users a flexible two-hour window to submit their tasks each day without breaking their streak, accommodating for slightly off-schedule days.</p>
<p>Of course, not every initial idea made it into the final product. I had to adapt. For instance, I originally wanted users to select their objective from a dropdown menu. Unfortunately, the current Discord API doesn't support that in the way I envisioned. My workaround was to have the user type the objective's name, and the bot then verifies if the objective exists in the database and is available for submission. It’s a practical solution that works well.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>Since I use Taskerbot daily, I'm constantly finding new things to improve and features to add. I have a few ideas that I plan to implement in the coming weeks, though I am also balancing this with another projects that I'll be sharing here soon.</p>
<p>I'd love for you to check it out and let me know what you think! Any feedback or suggestions for improvement would be greatly appreciated.</p>
