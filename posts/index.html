  <h2><a href="/posts/dev.update.11.25/">Dev-Update | November 2025</a></h2>
  <p class="post-date">Published on: November 09, 2025</p>
  <p>A quick progress update from the past few months: I have been setting up a small self-hosting environment, learning Docker and Kubernetes, building a few small tools, and helping a friend with QA. Below are the highlights with inline links to the projects mentioned.

</p>

  <h2><a href="/posts/bot_hosting/">An Update on TaskerBot's Hosting</a></h2>
  <p class="post-date">Published on: September 03, 2025</p>
  <p>
Finding a good host for TaskerBot turned out to be harder than I thought. After a few failed tries with other services, I've landed on a temporary solution: running it on my own machine with Docker.
</p>

  <h2><a href="/posts/taskerbot/">How I built Taskerbot</a></h2>
  <p class="post-date">Published on: June 27, 2025</p>
  <p>
Developing my latest project, a Discord bot called [Taskerbot](https://github.com/rsomonte/taskerbot), has been an interesting journey full of unexpected turns. The inspiration came from a bot I saw during an event on a Discord server that gamified tasks, and I decided to build my own version. This project quickly evolved into a valuable lesson in modern bot development, especially after a five-year hiatus from the Discord API.

  <h2><a href="/posts/languages/">Report on Language Learning Resources</a></h2>
  <p class="post-date">Published on: June 23, 2025</p>
  <p>Over years of studying languages, I've tested a wide array of learning tools. This report shares my personal experiences and ratings for each, from apps to websites, to help you choose the right one for your journey.

  <h2><a href="/posts/post2/">I hate deployment, don't even mention it</a></h2>
  <p class="post-date">Published on: May 26, 2025</p>
  <p>Seems like I’m not getting anything right on the first try. In this edition of *Dev Odysseys*, I’ll share the rollercoaster of deploying my website—complete with rage-quits, AI rescues, and GitHub Pages chaos.  
</p>

  <h2><a href="/posts/post1/">Building My First Website: Homer's Odyssey</a></h2>
  <p class="post-date">Published on: May 25, 2025</p>
  <p>It hasn’t been an easy ride to build this website—especially with my lack of web development experience. But I can confidently say I’ve learned a ton about the tools and technologies powering this site, and I’m here to share the messy journey.
