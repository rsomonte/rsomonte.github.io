<p>Seems like I’m not getting anything right on the first try. In this edition of <em>Dev Odysseys</em>, I’ll share the rollercoaster of deploying my website—complete with rage-quits, AI rescues, and GitHub Pages chaos.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>“It’ll Be Easy,” They Said</strong></h3>
<p>In my <a href="https://rsomonte.github.io/posts/post1/">last post</a>, I bragged about how 11ty would simplify deployment. <strong>Foreshadowing alert</strong>: this is where the universe decided to humble me (thank god y’all can’t see my graveyard of deleted repos).</p>
<p>I did what any sane person would: Googled <em>“11ty GitHub Pages”</em>. Dozens of tutorials popped up. “ez win!” I thought. <strong>Spoiler</strong>: It was not.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Great GitHub Pages Meltdown</strong></h3>
<p>First attempt: followed a tutorial. Styles broke. Links back to home. Tried manual fixes. Nothing. Switched to another guide. Same result. By this point, I’d had a <em>very</em> intense weekend and just wanted to finish this project. So I had only one last ace up the sleeve: <strong>rage-quit</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Redemption Arc (Thanks, 11ty Docs)</strong></h3>
<p>Next day, fresh coffee in hand(not quite, coffee is <em>disgusting</em>), I crawled back to <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty’s website</a>. Their <strong>site-wide search</strong> is like Bruno, we don't talk about it; but after some digging, I struck gold: the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/deployment/#deploy-an-eleventy-project-to-github-pages">official deployment guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It's alive!</strong> Their method worked… <em>mostly</em>. Styles still looked like a first grader's father's day website. However, I sometimes have genius ideas: I remembered that we live in the 21st century, and we have the commodity of AI to help us in some ocassions. A few prompts later, the last gremlins were squashed.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Dear Future Me (and You)</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re reading this while battling outdated 2022 tutorials (or worse, <strong>2020</strong> relics), know this: you’re not alone. Next time I’m drowning in deployment hell, I’ll drag y’all down with me—<em>gloriously</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for reading!</strong> If you’ve survived a deployment disaster, tell me about it—misery loves company.</p>
