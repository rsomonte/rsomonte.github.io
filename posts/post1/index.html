<p>It hasn’t been an easy ride to build this website—especially with my lack of web development experience. But I can confidently say I’ve learned a ton about the tools and technologies powering this site, and I’m here to share the messy journey.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why GitHub Pages and 11ty?</h3>
<p>My goal was to host this site on GitHub Pages, which meant sticking to <strong>static site generators</strong>. After seeing another developer struggle with self-hosting due to their non-static tech stack, I knew I needed a simpler path. Enter <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>.</p>
<p>At first, I thought 11ty’s templates would make this a walk in the park. Spoiler: it wasn’t. When I opened the default template in VS Code, I froze—<strong>so many files</strong>, so much code, and zero idea where to start. I tinkered with minor tweaks, but the rigid structure stifled my design creativity.</p>
<p>So, I did the only logical thing: <strong>scrapped the template entirely</strong> and started from scratch.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Baby Steps and Breakthroughs</h3>
<p>Armed with basic HTML/CSS knowledge from a web dev course I’d taken the previous semester, I dove into 11ty’s documentation. Progress was slow, but every tiny victory kept me going—whether it was fixing a rage-inducing bug after two hours of Googling or finally understanding how layouts worked.</p>
<p>Eventually, I circled back to the template I’d abandoned earlier—this time, not to copy it, but to <strong>borrow inspiration</strong> for my own design. I embraced 11ty’s <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/layouts/">layout system</a> to structure pages consistently, and things started falling into place.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The To-Do List Grind</h3>
<p>Once the skeleton of the site was built, I drafted a checklist of everything needed for launch: optimizing code, adding comments I’d lazily skipped, and experimenting with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> templating (a short-lived attempt—<strong>it’s still on my bucket list</strong>).</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Final Stretch</h3>
<p>Two hours. That’s how long I spent agonizing over the perfect color scheme (you better appreciate that palette). After endless tweaks, the site was finally “presentable”—or at least, not embarrassing.</p>
